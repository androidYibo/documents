problemformulering

I want to design and develop a Haskell library for quantitative finance, taking the open
source quantlib as a starting point. The laungage Haskell is used
because of its purity and advanced type class system which allows to model
relevant entities. The result of my project should be a software 
architecture that supports different kinds of financial instruments and
valuation methods.
