In Quantlib an Instrument is described as a base clase that derives the
specifik instruments. This is done to allow code in the Model 
that does not specify which kind of instrument we are calculating.

An example of such code could be.
   for ( i = portfolio.begin ( ) ; i != portfolio.end ( ) ; ++ i )
      totalNPV += i âˆ’> NPV ( ) ; (from QuantLib book chapter 2)

This is a very attractive feature we would like to keep in HQL. 
(as it has been done in HQL).


A VanillaSwap in QuantLib contains a fixed and floating leg.
